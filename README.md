# Dodge-the-Squares
A pretty straightforward game. Control your yellow circle and avoid the red blocks bouncing haphazardly around you for as long as possible. You can press ESC to pause the game, which actually opens up some strategies for quick movement if your reflexes are good enough.

This project was an experiment in both JavaFX (I decided it was time to move on from AWT) and JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA. I'm pretty happy with both of them. IntelliJ is pretty smart, so I think I'll stick with it for a while.
